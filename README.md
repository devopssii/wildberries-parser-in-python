## Overview
The WildBerries Parser is a Python script that allows you to collect information on items from the [Wildberries](https://wildberries.ru) website and save it into an xlsx file. The parser provides two modes: scanning items in a specific directory of the marketplace or parsing all items in the search results based on a given keyword. It collects various data from each item, including the link, ID, name, brand name, regular price, discounted price, rating, number of reviews, and total sales.

## Features
